In this SQL query exercise, I have used various types of SQL joins to extract data from multiple tables in a database.

First, we used a subquery to find the count of employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of department_id 30.

Then, we used a simple join to find the average salary of employees who work in the Executive department.

Next, we used a complex join to find the count of employees who have a salary greater than the average salary of the shipping department, excluding those who have a job title of President.

We also filtered employees who work in the US using another join statement.

Lastly, we used a group by clause to find the country-wise average salary of employees by joining multiple tables.
